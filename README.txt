Cell images are in directory: original_cell_type_images
Use cell_classifier.ipynb to classify images and visualize layer activations.
Use test_classifier.ipynb to analyze classifier accuracy.
Use retrain_helper.ipynb to train a new model.

Only a few pretrained model .pb files are included in repo due to large size. You can generate them using retrain_helper.ipynb, and then use them to classify images using cell_classifier.ipynb.
